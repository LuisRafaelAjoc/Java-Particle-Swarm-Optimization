# Java-Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Visualizer
A simple implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization Visualizer in Java. Final Project for CC 204: Data Structures and Algorithms

Just run Main.java
Left-click to assign goal state in search space.

setConfiguration (Particle initial positions):

1 - randomized all over the search space

2 - randomized positions in a 100x100 box at the top left corner

3 - randomized positions in a 200x200 box at the top left corner

Note regarding obstacles: The particles are incapable of navigating around them and simply teleport to open space. Might improve upon in another project by combining it with another algorithm.
